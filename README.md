# processingEducationalTool
An interactive web-tool that demonstrates some basic functions of processing.


This simple web-tool demonstrates how translate, scale, and rotate work in processing. I developed this tool as a instructional aid for teaching processing. This was made using p5.js however it is applicable to any version of processing.
